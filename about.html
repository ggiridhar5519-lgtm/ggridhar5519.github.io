  <main class="page">
    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
      I am a DevOps Engineer with 6+ years of hands-on experience in AWS and Azure,
      specializing in CI/CD automation, Kubernetes (EKS/AKS), Docker, and
      Infrastructure as Code.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have worked across Retail, Insurance, and Healthcare domains, delivering
      scalable, secure, and highly available cloud-native platforms. I strongly
      believe in automation, observability, and zero-downtime releases.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am comfortable working in Agile/Scrum environments and collaborating
      closely with development, QA, and business teams to ship reliable systems
      to production.
